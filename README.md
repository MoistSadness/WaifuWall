An interesting thing that happened while working on this project was that the tutorial's premade styles didn't work with the components; all the icons were in the wrong places and nothing worked like it did in the demo video. I spent about an hour trying to make everything work before I realized MUI is basically what Bootstrap is for normal websites and just made the cards myself using their documentation as reference.
